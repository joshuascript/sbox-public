# Run ./sbox under gdb and auto-capture a full backtrace whenever the Vulkan
# swapchain reports a present stall.
#
# The target is this, from librendersystemvulkan.so:
#
#   CSwapChainBase::QueuePresentAndWait() looped for %d iterations without a
#   present event.
#
# The swapchain allows one outstanding present (m_nMaxOutstanding = 1 from the
# ctor) and waits on the device's present-completed event in 10 ms slices, up to
# (outstanding + 20) times - so "21 iterations" is one un-retired present and
# ~210 ms of waiting. It then returns false and the frame is dropped. What we want
# to know is which thread failed to retire it, which means a snapshot of every
# thread's stack at the moment the warning is emitted.
#
# gdb breaks on tier0's Warning(), matches the format string, dumps all threads
# and resumes on its own - the game is never left halted, so one run collects
# every occurrence.
#
# Usage:
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-sbox-gdb.sh                    launch game/sbox
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-sbox-gdb.sh -somearg           pass args through to sbox
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-sbox-gdb.sh --dry-run          print the setup and exit
#
# Env overrides (see bootstrap-linux/gdb/present-trace.py for the full set):
#   SBOX_EXE=sbox-dev        trace the editor instead of the client
#   SBOX_GDB_BT="bt"         shallower per-thread backtrace than the default bt full
#   SBOX_GDB_MAX_DUMPS=0     no cap on the number of dumps (default 20)
#   SBOX_GDB_TRACE_MSG=1     also catch the "Hitch alert" / "frames ahead" lines,
#                            which go through Msg() rather than Warning()
#   SBOX_GDB_SKIP_THREADS=   regex of thread names to omit (default ^\.NET)
#   SBOX_GDB_STOP_SEGV=1     halt on SIGSEGV/SIGBUS instead of passing them through
set -euo pipefail
