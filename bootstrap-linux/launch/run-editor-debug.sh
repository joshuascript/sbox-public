# Launch the editor with the Linux input diagnostics turned on.
#
# Wraps run-editor.sh (which handles the HarfBuzz preload and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and adds:
#
#   SBOX_INPUT_DEBUG=1   the managed diagnostics - [inputdbg] from the scene viewport,
#                        [routerdbg] from InputRouter, [gamemode] at the play handover.
#                        All land in game/logs/sbox-dev.log.
#
# SPY=1 additionally preloads libsdlspy.so, an LD_PRELOAD shim counting the SDL event
# plumbing (SDL_PushEvent / PollEvent, the relative-mouse + grab calls, window ids).
#
# The spy is OPT-IN because it is not free. It interposes SDL_PushEvent and
# SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode, and interposing on the render path has produced
# "The selected graphics queue does not support presenting a swapchain image" plus a fatal
# Wayland disconnect - see the gotchas in bootstrap-linux/linux-input.md. Always re-verify a
# finding against a no-spy run before believing it.
#
# Reach for SPY=1 only for the things managed code structurally cannot see, all of them below
# the interop boundary:
#   - is the Qt->SDL bridge emitting at all (SDL_PushEvent), as opposed to events not being
#     delivered - InputRouter's own counters only see what survived the trip
#   - the actual X grab (SDL_SetWindowMouseGrab), as distinct from our request for relative mode
#   - which SDL window id events are stamped with
# For capture state, focus, delivery rates and the Qt mouse-move rate, the managed [routerdbg]
# and [gamemode] lines already cover it.
#
# It opens a project directly rather than going through the launcher: sbox-dev without
# -project re-execs sbox-launcher as a SEPARATE process and returns, so the editor you
# end up looking at is not the one you launched, and the env vars above never reach it.
#
# Usage:
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-editor-debug.sh                       open the sweeper sample
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-editor-debug.sh /path/to/.sbproj      open some other project
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-editor-debug.sh -- -someflag          pass extra flags through to sbox-dev
#   bootstrap-linux/launch/run-editor-debug.sh --dry-run             print the setup and exit, launching nothing
#   SPY=1 bootstrap-linux/launch/run-editor-debug.sh                 also preload the SDL spy (see above)
#
# Env overrides:
#   SPY=1              preload libsdlspy.so as well (default: off)
#   SPY_LOG=/path      where the SDL spy writes      (default: game/logs/sdlspy.log)
set -euo pipefail

# This lives in bootstrap-linux/launch/, so the repo root is two levels up.
