# Launch the s&box editor with the engine's own HarfBuzz preloaded.
#
# The engine ships libHarfBuzzSharp.so (SkiaSharp's statically-linked HarfBuzz) in
# game/bin/linuxsteamrt64, but the system's libharfbuzz.so.0 also ends up in the
# process - pulled in through Qt's xcb platform plugin, fontconfig and the GTK
# portal used for file dialogs. Both export the same unversioned hb_* names, so
# calls get spread across two copies: an hb_buffer allocated by one is handed to
# the other's free(), and glibc aborts with "free(): invalid pointer".
#
# LD_PRELOAD puts the engine's copy first in the global symbol scope, so every
# hb_* reference in the process - the engine's and the system libraries' - binds
# to that single implementation.
#
# Env overrides:
#   SBOX_EXE=sbox            launch a different binary from game/ (default sbox-dev)
#   SBOX_HARFBUZZ=/path.so   preload a different HarfBuzz (e.g. the system one, to
#                            force everything onto that copy instead)
